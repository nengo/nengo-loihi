    "layers and a dense layer.\n",

    "model that we want to run on neuromorphic hardware, we want the whole model that we've\n",

    "at least one layer that runs *off*-chip to convert the input signal to spikes to send to\n",
    "the rest of the model running on Loihi.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll add a `Conv2D` layer to run off-chip and convert the input signal to spikes. This\n",
    "could also be an `Activation` layer. The advantage to the `Activation` layer is that it\n",
    "adds no extra parameters and minimizes off-chip computations. The `Conv2D` layer uses a\n",
    "few parameters, and requires a bit more off-chip computation, but gives the network much\n",
    "more flexibility as to how pixels are converted to spikes. An `Activation` layer would\n",
    "likely work well for simple images like MNIST, but for more complex images (e.g. with\n",
    "more than one color channel, or a wider range of intensity values) the flexibility of\n",
    "the `Conv2D` layer is important. We avoid layers like the `Dense` layer, as it\n",
    "significantly increases both the number of parameters and the number of computations\n",
    "that have to be run off-chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the output side of the network, we now have to worry about how many neurons are in\n",
    "the last layer run on the chip. We are limited in how many neurons we can record from on\n",
    "the board, so we add a `Dense` layer with 100 neurons between the last `Conv2D` layer\n",
    "and our 10-dimensional `Dense` output layer (which runs off-chip). This way, we only\n",
    "have to record from 100 neurons, rather than the 2,304 neurons we would need to record\n",
    "from if we connected directly from the last `Conv2D` layer to the 10-dimensional output.\n",
    "An added benefit is that the amount of off-chip computation is reduced, since the number\n",
    "of weights used by the off-chip output layer is 100 x 10 instead of 2304 x 10."
