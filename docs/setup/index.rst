These pages are for Loihi system administrators
or other individuals who are setting up a Loihi system
for the first time.

While other parts of NengoLoihi documentation
are written with enough ambiguity that
they should work on a variety of different setups,
this page is specific to certain hardware designs
and has complete explicit steps.
As such, these instructions are not likely to work
with other designs,
and as these designs and other infrastructure change,
these instructions may no longer work.
If you run into problems,
please contact the hardware distributor
(usually Intel).
