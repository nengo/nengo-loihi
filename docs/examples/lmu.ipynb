    "a novel recurrent neural network architecture, described in\n",
    "[Voelker, KajiÄ‡, and Eliasmith (NeurIPS 2019)][paper].\n",
    "We will not go into much of the underlying details of these methods here;\n",
    "broadly speaking, we can think of an LMU as a recurrent network\n",
    "that does a very good job of representing\n",
    "the temporal information in some input signal.\n",
    "Since most RNN tasks involve computing\n",
    "some function of that temporal information,\n",
    "the better the RNN is at representing the temporal information\n",
    "the better it will be able to perform the task.\n",
    "See the [paper][] for all the details!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will show how an LMU can be used\n",
    "to delay an input signal for some fixed length of time.\n",
    "This is a simple sounding task, but performing an accurate delay\n",
    "requires the network to store the complete history of the input signal\n",
    "across the delay period.\n",
    "So it is a good measure of a network's fundamental temporal storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this example is essentially the same as the\n",
    "[\"LMUs in Nengo\" example](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples/learning/lmu.html),\n",
    "except that here we use Loihi to simulate the network.\n",
    "The main difference is that we use an `EnsembleArray` to implement\n",
    "the LMU cell in spiking neurons, rather than using a linear \n",
