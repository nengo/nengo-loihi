class Model:
    """The data structure for the emulator/hardware simulator.

    Defines methods for adding inputs, blocks and probes. Also handles build
    functions, and information associated with building the Nengo model.

    Some of the Model attributes can be modified before the build process
    to change how certain build functions work. Those attributes are listed
    first in the attributes section below. To change them, create an instance
    of `.Model` and pass it in to `.Simulator` along with your network::

        model = nengo_loihi.builder.Model(dt=0.001)
        model.pes_error_scale = 50.

        with nengo_loihi.Simulator(network, model=model) as sim:
            sim.run(1.0)

    Parameters
    ----------
    dt : float, optional (Default: 0.001)
        The length of a simulator timestep, in seconds.
    label : str, optional (Default: None)
        A name or description to differentiate models.
    builder : Builder, optional (Default: None)
        A `.Builder` instance to keep track of build functions.
        If None, the default builder will be used.

    Attributes
    ----------

    Build parameters

    decode_neurons : DecodeNeurons
        Type of neurons used to facilitate decoded (NEF-style) connections.
    decode_tau : float
        Time constant of lowpass synaptic filter used with decode neurons.
    intercept_limit : float
        Limit for clipping intercepts, to avoid neurons with high gains.
    node_neurons : DecodeNeurons
        Type of neurons used to convert real-valued node outputs to spikes
        for the chip.
    pes_error_scale : float
        Scaling for PES errors, before rounding and clipping to -127..127.
    pes_wgt_exp : int
        Learning weight exponent (base 2) for PES learning connections. This
        controls the maximum weight magnitude (where a larger exponent means
        larger potential weights, but lower weight resolution).
    vth_nonspiking : float
        Voltage threshold for non-spiking neurons (i.e. voltage decoders).

    Internal attributes

    blocks : dict
        Mapping from Loihi blocks to a unique integer for that block.
    block_shapes : dict
        Mapping from Loihi blocks to `.BlockShape` instances.
    builder : Builder
        The build functions used by this model.
    dt : float
        The length of a simulator timestep, in seconds.
    chip2host_params : dict
        Mapping from Nengo objects to any additional parameters associated
        with those objects for use during the build process.
    inputs : list of LoihiInput
        List of inputs to this model.
    label : str or None
        A name or description to differentiate models.
    objs : dict
        Dictionary mapping from Nengo objects to NengoLoihi objects.
    params : dict
        Mapping from objects to namedtuples containing parameters generated
        in the build process.
    probes : list
        List of probes on this model.
    seeded : dict
        All objects are assigned a seed, whether the user defined the seed
        or it was automatically generated. 'seeded' keeps track of whether
        the seed is user-defined. We consider the seed to be user-defined
        if it was set directly on the object, or if a seed was set on the
        network in which the object resides, or if a seed was set on any
        ancestor network of the network in which the object resides.
    seeds : dict
        Mapping from objects to the integer seed assigned to that object.
